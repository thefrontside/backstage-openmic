## Getting started

### Prerequisites
Node `v10+`

### Installation

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/josephdyer/skeleventy.git`
2. `cd` into the project folder and run `npm install`
3. Start the local development server by running `npm run dev` **Tip:** _Eleventy has live reload baked in!_

## Ready to deploy?

The ```npm run production``` command will remove any unused CSS with Purgecss and minify the CSS and JS files.

I highly recommend using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to host your site on, so I've included a ```netlify.toml``` configuration file for your convenience.
